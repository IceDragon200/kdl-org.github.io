    kdl is a document language, mostly based on
    <a href="https://sdlang.org/">SDLang</a>, with xml-like semantics that looks
    like you're invoking a bunch of CLI commands!
  </p>

  <p>
    It's meant to be used both as a serialization format and a configuration
    language, and is relatively light on syntax compared to XML.
